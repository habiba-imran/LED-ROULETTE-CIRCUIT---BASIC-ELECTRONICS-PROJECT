# LED Roulette Circuit Using 555 Timer & 4017 IC

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an LED roulette circuit using the 555 Timer IC and 4017 Decade Counter IC. The circuit mimics the spinning effect of a roulette wheel by sequentially lighting up LEDs in a dynamic pattern. The project is designed for educational purposes to help understand digital logic, timing circuits, and sequential control.

## Objective
- To demonstrate the practical application of a 555 Timer and 4017 IC in generating clock pulses and controlling LED sequences.
- To explore how clock generation, counting, and output sequencing work in digital circuits.
- To provide a hands-on learning experience in building circuits, troubleshooting, and modifying components.

## Components Required
- 555 Timer IC
- 4017 IC
- PNP Transistor (e.g., BC557)
- 10 LEDs
- Resistor (100kΩ)
- Resistor (10MΩ)
- Capacitors (1µF, 100nF)
- Breadboard and connectors
- Touch contacts
- Power supply (5-12V)

## Software Used
- **Proteus**: For circuit design and simulation.

## Circuit Design & Simulation
The LED Roulette Circuit uses a 555 Timer IC in astable mode to generate clock pulses, which drive a 4017 Decade Counter IC to sequentially light up LEDs. The speed of the LED rotation can be adjusted by modifying the timing components.

## Procedure
1. The 1µF capacitor charges when both touch contacts are pressed, which influences the 555 Timer frequency and subsequently adjusts the speed of the LED sequence.
2. The 4017 IC receives clock pulses from the 555 Timer and lights up the LEDs sequentially.
3. When the touch contacts are removed, the frequency decreases, causing the LEDs to slow down and eventually stop.

## Discussion
- **Challenges Faced**: Some issues encountered during the project included faulty components, incorrect timing values, and power supply inconsistencies.
- **Potential Improvements**: The circuit can be enhanced with adjustable timing using a potentiometer, RGB LEDs for better visuals, and microcontroller integration (e.g., Arduino) for programmable effects.

## Future Work
- Incorporating advanced visual effects and programmable patterns using microcontrollers.
- Optimizing power efficiency through better component choices.
- Exploring ways to teach digital logic through interactive elements in the circuit.

## Conclusion
The LED Roulette Circuit successfully demonstrates how timing circuits, sequential logic, and ICs can work together to create dynamic and visually engaging displays. The project provides valuable hands-on experience in designing circuits and troubleshooting electronic components.
